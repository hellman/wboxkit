# `wboxkit`: White-box Cryptography Design and Analysis kit

This project is a successor of the previous [`cryptolu/whitebox`](https://github.com/cryptolu/whitebox/tree/master/synthesis) framework proposed at the [WhibOx 2019](https://www.cryptoexperts.com/whibox2019/) workshop, which was written in Python 2 and used custom Boolean circuits. The new version (this repo) is rewritten for Python 3 and also is based on the recent more generic circuit framework [circkit](https://github.com/cryptoexperts/circkit). It also brings improved interfaces and some [tutorials](./tutorials/) (first presented at the [CHES 2022 White-box Cryptography tutorial](https://ches.iacr.org/2022/tutorials.php)).

The primary usecase of `wboxkit` is research and experiments on white-box cryptography implementation.

It is not yet documented, but the examples in the tutorials should be sufficient for many purposes.

## Installation

It can be installed from PyPI using pip (a C extension requires a compiler and the python-dev package). It is recommended to use [PyPy3](https://www.pypy.org/download.html) which offers much better performance.

```sh
pip install wboxkit
# or
pypy -m pip install wboxkit
```

For the LDA (linear algebraic / linear decoding attack) to work, it has to be installed with [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/):

```sh
sage -pip install wboxkit
sage -sh
$ wboxkit.lda traces/
```

## Scripts

The package installed a few scripts:

- `wboxkit.trace` records a set of computational traces of a given Boolean circuit (serialized in a file).
- `wboxkit.exact` performs the exact matching attack.
- `wboxkit.lda` performs the linear decoding / linear algebraic attack (LDA).
